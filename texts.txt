ABOUT ME

    What does Erick do?

    Nothing basically! Bro is an ungrateful unemployed brat who does whatever the fuck he feels like doing. 
    Stubborn, Selfish, Lazy, Foolish, Greedy, Arrogant, Irresponsible, Impulsive, Impatient, Narcisstic, Manipulative, Cynical, Self-centered, Cowardly and the list goes on and on and on and on and on.

    Can he become a better person? 

    He can.

    WILL he become a better person?

    He might(not)   

    What other things does he do? surely he has something else to do other than wasting his time, right?

    He does Web Development. 
        He's still not that good at it. But remember, "Short steps long vision".
    He loves listening to music. 
        "The best distraction to life" as he said. His favourite runaways.
    He read books.
        Doesn't really suit him, but he is picking up this habit lately.
    He plays video games. (way too much)
        Ever since last year, he's been toning down on his video gaming. Maybe he'll play other kinds of "game".
    
    And that's it. 
    For now. All you need to know about him.
